# readNSx

The goal of `readNSx` is to read in `Blackrock-Microsystem` files
(`.nev`, `.nsx`) and save the information to common formats that are
well-supported by R, Python, Matlab.

## Installation

The package is on `CRAN` soon. Install it via

``` r
install.packages("readNSx")
```

You can install the nightly development version of `readNSx` from
[r-universe](https://dipterix.r-universe.dev/readNSx)

``` r
# Enable repository from dipterix
options(repos = c(
  dipterix = 'https://dipterix.r-universe.dev',
  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
  
# Download and install readNSx in R
install.packages('readNSx')
```

## How to use `readNSx`

[Click
here](https://dipterix.org/readNSx/articles/read-nev-nsx-data.html) to
read “not that detailed” manual including usage, anatomy of `readNSx`.

### Import into RAVE

To import the data into `RAVE (R Analysis and Visualization of iEEG)`,
use the following code as an example.

``` r
readNSx::import_nsp(
  path = "~/EMU_RAW/EMU-008_sub-YAB_task-congruency_run-01_NSP-1.nev", 
  prefix = "~/rave_data/raw/YAB/block008", 
  exclude_events = "spike", partition_prefix = "_part"
)
```

The raw data is stored as
`EMU-008_sub-YAB_task-congruency_run-01_NSP-1.nev` along with `ns3` and
`ns5`. The data will be written to `RAVE` raw-data path under
`~/rave_data/raw/`, as `YAB/block008_part1`, `YAB/block008_part2`, …
(one block of data may contain multiple segments of continuous
recordings). The above example also avoids reading default
`spike-waveforms`. Simply set `exclude_events=NULL` will enable default
spike clusters. If you just want to import certain `NSx` files (for
example, only `ns3`), then check `exclude_nsx` parameter.

### Import to `BIDS`-like format

`Blackrock-Microsystem` data is incompatible with `BIDS`. It lacks
several critical information and require manually edits. However, you
may use `import_nsp` to import into `BIDS`-like format.

``` r
readNSx::import_nsp(
  path = "~/EMU_RAW/EMU-008_sub-YAB_task-congruency_run-01_NSP-1.nev", 
  prefix = file.path(
    "~/BIDSRoot/MyDataSet/sub-YAB/ses-008/ieeg/",
    "sub-YAB_ses-008_task-congruency_acq-NSP1_run-01"
  ), 
  exclude_events = "spike", partition_prefix = "/part"
)
```
